STEP:1 - BUILD DOCKER IMAGE

Inorder to build the docker image, run the command:
docker build -t ayush0404/ruby:v1

I have saved the image in my Dockerhub.
A good practice is to store in the image in the private container registry. For example: We can store the images in the
Google container registry in GCP.
